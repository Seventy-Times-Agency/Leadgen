"""Client-side observability protocols for a long-running search.

``run_search`` used to talk directly to aiogram: it edited a Telegram
message for progress and called ``bot.send_*`` to deliver the result.
That coupling made the pipeline untestable outside a full Telegram
stack and blocked the web adapter. The two protocols below are the
seam:

- ``ProgressSink`` — receives phase transitions and progress bar
  updates. Telegram implements it via ``bot.edit_message_text``; the
  web adapter will push JSON events over SSE; a CLI could just print.
- ``DeliverySink`` — receives the final stats card, insights, top
  leads and Excel bytes. Telegram sends messages + a document; the
  web adapter will persist them for the dashboard to render.

Both protocols are ``runtime_checkable`` Protocols, so callers can
``isinstance()``-check a sink without worrying about nominal typing.
``NullSink`` is a no-op default for CLI / batch use.
